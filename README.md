## Overview
This Swift project leverages Vision OS to create an immersive Augmented Reality (AR) timeline that visually chronicles the significant events in a person's life or career. The timeline starts with a few key milestones and allows users to explore more detailed events interactively.

## Key Features
* **Interactive AR Timeline**: View a person's timeline in an AR environment, with significant events plotted along a visually engaging path.
* **Expandable Event Details**: Users can click on a timeline event labeled "See More" to reveal additional events that occurred between the selected milestone and the next one. For instance, selecting "Oct 2004, Promotion to COO" on Tim Cook's timeline will display events leading up to his appointment as CEO in August 2011.

## Use Cases
* **Historical Figures**: Explore the life and achievements of historical figures with dynamically expanding timelines.
* **Career Highlights**: Visualize career progressions, promotions, and key decisions in an interactive format.
* **Educational Tool**: Use the AR timeline for teaching history, biographies, and other subjects where chronological understanding is crucial.

### Stretch Goals:
- Add form to get an Open AI API Token
- Connect to Chat GPT
- Add drag gesture to pull timeline closer or move it around
- Add pinch gestures to resize timeline
  - The event placements are already relative to the length of the timeline, so this should be a easy addition
